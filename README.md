# Volley
2D physics based volleyball game against naive computer

for educational purposes.
This started as a simple, 3 script game, but the "volleyball.cs" script got complicated quickly in order to enforce points, rules, serves.
And the PC script is getting complicated too in order for the "AI" player to become a somewhat enjoyable opponent
